    <p>Union Station is an Amtrak railroad station and mixed-use commercial building in downtown Erie, in the U.S. state of
      Pennsylvania. The Lake Shore Limited provides passenger service between Chicago, New York City, and Boston; Erie is
      the train's only stop in Pennsylvania. The station's ground floor has been redeveloped into commercial spaces, including
      The Brewerie at Union Station, a brewpub. The building itself is privately owned by the global logistics and freight
      management company Logistics Plus and serves as its headquarters.</p>

    <p>The first railroad station in Erie was established in 1851 but was replaced with the Romanesque Revival-style Union Depot
      in 1866. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions by competing railroad companies which started not long after
      the establishment of Erie's first railroads, Union Depot became jointly owned and operated by the New York Central
      and Pennsylvania railroads. To meet the changing needs of the rapidly growing city, planners designed a more modern
      structure to replace the original depot. The new Art Deco Union Station, dedicated on December 3, 1927, was the first
      railroad station of that style in the United States.</p>

    <p>While Union Station was busy from its opening and through World War II, passenger rail service began to dwindle after
      the war when air and highway travel became more popular. By the 1960s, the New York Central drastically cut service,
      while the Pennsylvania abandoned service to Erie altogether. Both railroads were merged in 1968 to form Penn Central,
      and passenger rail was transferred from Penn Central to Amtrak in 1971. At one point, from 1972 to 1975, even Amtrak
      service in Erie was suspended. With reduced demand for train travel, Union Station was neglected and allowed to decay
      until Logistics Plus bought it in 2003. Since then it has been restored, with portions re-purposed as commercial and
      retail space.</p>
